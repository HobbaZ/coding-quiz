# Coding-Quiz

I was tasked with creating a coding quiz to test users on a variety of Javascript and HTML centered questions.

When you press the start button, the timer will give you 2 minutes to answer 5 questions, decrementing the time by 10 seconds each time you get a question wrong or adding to your score each time you get a question right.

After you complete the quiz, you'll be asked to enter your initials and the Save Score button will save your score to the high scores page.

A bug that I've found is after you enter your initials and the quiz resets, it will skip right to the end if you press start again (too late to fix this issue).
