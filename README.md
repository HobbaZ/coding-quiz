# Coding-Quiz

I was tasked with creating a coding quiz to test users on a variety of Javascript and HTML centered questions.

When you press the start button, the timer will give you 2 minutes to answer 5 questions, decrementing the time by 10 seconds each time you get a question wrong or adding to your score each time you get a question right.

After you complete the quiz, you'll be asked to enter your initials and the Save Score button will save your score to the high scores page.
